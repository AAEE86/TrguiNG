# Transmission Remote GUI (next gen)

`TransguiNG` is a rewrite of [transgui](https://github.com/transmission-remote-gui/transgui)
project using [tauri](https://tauri.studio/) and modern technology stack: react.js and rust.

Some new features are planned to extend the functionality of the original transgui app:
* Multi server interface - manage all your transmission daemons at once
* Better filtering and label support
* Themes and more

Legacy transmission versions will not be supported (goal is to have v2.40 and up compatibility).

Project is distributed under GNU Affero General Public License v3, see `LICENSE.txt` for details.
